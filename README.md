# CMPINF-0010-Final-Project

This repository contains our group's submission for the final project of Big Ideas (CPMINF 0010). 

The goal of the code is to determine the best neighborhood in or around Pittsburgh based on metrics of our choosing. We decided that the best quality neighborhood would also have the highest cost of living. A high cost of living implies that life is generally more luxurious, comfortable, and convenient. By looking into datasets relating to rent, mortgage, income, and housing costs, we were able to judge the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.
