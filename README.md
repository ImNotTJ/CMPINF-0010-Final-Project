Metric:

By observing each neighborhood's cost of living and incomes, the best neighborhood can be found easily.
A high cost of living and more incomes imply that life must be luxurious, so the neighborhood with all of these qualities would be the best:

1. High rent
2. High housing cost
3. Residents have a sustainable income
4. Houses are mortgage-free / paid off
